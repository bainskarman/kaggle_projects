# Kaggle Housing Prices Competition

Welcome to the Kaggle Housing Prices Competition project repository. This project focuses on predicting housing prices using machine learning techniques. The project covers a wide range of tasks, including preprocessing, feature extraction, transformation, pipelining, ensemble techniques, and grid search for hyperparameter tuning.

## Competition Overview

The objective of this competition is to predict the sale prices of residential homes based on various features such as square footage, neighborhood, number of bedrooms, etc. The dataset is provided by Kaggle and includes both training and testing datasets.

## Directory Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset for training and testing.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks with data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Key Stages and Techniques

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values, outlier detection, and data cleaning.

2. **Feature Extraction and Transformation**
   - Extracting meaningful features and transforming variables for better model performance.

3. **Pipelining**
   - Creating data processing pipelines to streamline the workflow and ensure consistency.

4. **Ensemble Techniques**
   - Utilizing ensemble techniques such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Stacking to improve predictive performance.

5. **Grid Search**
   - Conducting grid search for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
