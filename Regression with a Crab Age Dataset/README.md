# Crab Age Regression Project

Welcome to the Crab Age Regression project repository. This project focuses on predicting the age of crabs using machine learning regression techniques. The project includes various regression models, such as XGBoost Regressor, RandomForest Regressor, Linear Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regressor. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

## Dataset Overview

The Crab Age Dataset is used in this project, containing features related to crab morphology and measurements. The target variable is the age of the crabs.

## Key Regression Models

1. **XGBoost Regressor**
   - Implementation of the XGBoost regression algorithm, known for its speed and performance.

2. **RandomForest Regressor**
   - Ensemble learning method that builds a multitude of decision trees to improve accuracy and control overfitting.

3. **Linear Regression**
   - Simple yet effective linear regression model for predicting numerical values.

4. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
   - Ensemble technique that builds a series of weak learners to create a strong predictive model.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

GridSearchCV is utilized for hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal set of parameters for each regression model, maximizing predictive performance.
