In this scenario, a logistics company has shared a dataset of network-wide deliveries and their corresponding trip costs. The task at hand is to build a model that can accurately predict the cost of deliveries, enabling the company to optimize its network and improve its overall efficiency."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["[Back to Table of Contents](#0.1)\n","## Business Case Evaluation <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"2\"></a>\n","\n","#### Problem definition\n","The prediction of the delivery cost is requested.\n","\n","Evaluation Metric : RMSE Score\n","\n","The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n","trip,cost\n","t333282728025, 23.3433"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["[Back to Table of Contents](#0.1)\n","## Data Identification <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"3\"></a>\n","The data contains information related to Logistic Company.<br><br>\n","\n","|COLUMN| DESCRIPTION|\n","|:--|:--|\n","|Trip|Trip id|\n","|Date|Date, when trip was made|\n","|DayPart|Day or Night|\n","|ExWeatherTag|Heat/Snow|\n","|OriginLocation|Source location|\n","|DestinationLocation|Destination location|\n","|Distance|distance traveled|\n","|Type|Expedited or Not|\n","|Weight|weight carried by carriers|\n","|PackageType |Type of packages|\n","|carrier|Name of the carriers|\n","\n","\n","Datasets\n","Training data –Training dataset contains 38999 observations.\n","Actual responses (labels) are in the variable called ‘Cost’ Testing data – contains 802 observations with 11 variables and no labels"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Metadata \n","Kaggel Competition<br>\n","**File descriptions**<br>\n","train.csv -
