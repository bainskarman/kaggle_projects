# Trip Cost Prediction for a Logistics Company

Welcome to the repository for the Kaggle inter-class competition project - "Trip Cost Prediction for a Logistics Company." This project focuses on leveraging both machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) techniques to predict the cost of trips for a logistics company.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop accurate and efficient models for predicting the cost of trips undertaken by a logistics company. The dataset provided by Kaggle includes various features such as distance, weight, vehicle type, and other relevant parameters that influence the cost of each trip.

## Directory Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Machine Learning Techniques

The project employs traditional machine learning techniques such as:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
