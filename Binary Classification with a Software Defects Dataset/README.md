# Software Defects Detection

Welcome to the Software Defects Detection project repository. This project focuses on binary classification to predict the presence or absence of software defects using a dedicated dataset. Various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, and Logistic Regressor, have been employed for this purpose.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains features related to software development metrics, code complexity, and other relevant parameters. The target variable indicates whether a software module has defects (1) or not (0).


## Algorithms Used

1. **Random Forest Classifier**
   - Ensemble learning method that builds a multitude of decision trees and merges them together to improve accuracy and control overfitting.

2. **XGBoost Classifier**
   - Gradient boosting algorithm that has proven effective in various machine learning competitions. It's known for its speed and performance.

3. **Logistic Regressor**
   - A simple yet powerful algorithm for binary classification. It models the probability of the default class via a logistic function.
