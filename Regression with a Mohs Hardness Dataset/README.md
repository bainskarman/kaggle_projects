# Mohs Hardness Regression Project

Welcome to the Mohs Hardness Regression project repository. This project focuses on predicting Mohs hardness using two different approaches: a neural network with Keras and machine learning with custom ensemble techniques.

## Dataset Overview

The Mohs Hardness Dataset is used in this project, containing features related to material properties. The target variable is the Mohs hardness.

## Neural Network with Keras

1. **Keras Neural Network Notebook**
   - Located in the directory, this notebook covers the implementation of a neural network using the Keras framework for predicting Mohs hardness. It includes model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Custom Ensemble Techniques

2. **Custom Ensemble Techniques Notebook**
   - Also located in the directory, this notebook explores custom ensemble techniques for machine learning regression. It may include techniques such as stacking, blending, or any custom ensemble approach tailored for the Mohs Hardness prediction task.
